# The Monkees website

This is my first milestone project for Code Institute Full-stack Developer course.
The task was to create website for 1980's band The Monkees.

# UX

This website was built to showcase The Monkees band and their music to anyone who's interested in their work. Page is fully responsive and can be viewed on all devices.
While creating this site I implemented 5 planes of user experience design.

The goal of the project was for user to be able to experience work and history of the band. Prior to writing HTML I created a mockup for the project using pen and paper.
Mockup can be viewed here: assets\images\TheMonkees_mockup.JPG

# Features

1.Logo - Original The Monkees logo with bands name in the form of acoustic guitar.

2.Navbar - Transparent sticky-top navbar for easy reach of any section of website.

3.Band - Section in which band member names and profile pictures are displayed with the links to wikipedia description about them.

4.Music - Section with embedded spotify iframes for easy access to bands work.

5.Videos - Embedded youtube iframes showcasing some of the bandâ€™s best hit videos. Unfortunately the author restricted playback of the videos.
